## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! This project showcases my work as an AI engineer developing computer vision models using OpenCV and Python. It focuses on practical implementations of key computer vision tasks such as image preprocessing, object detection, and real-time video processing, with an emphasis on performance, modularity, and real-world usability.

The first core component of this project is image preprocessing, where raw visual data is prepared for downstream analysis. Techniques like resizing, normalization, noise reduction, histogram equalization, and color space transformations are applied to enhance image quality and ensure consistency. These preprocessing pipelines are designed to be flexible and adaptable to a variety of datasets and lighting conditions.

The project also features object detection using both traditional and deep learning-based approaches. Iâ€™ve implemented models such as Haar cascades, HOG+SVM, and more advanced frameworks like YOLO and SSD through integration with TensorFlow, PyTorch, or ONNX. Detection pipelines include bounding box post-processing, confidence scoring, and class label overlay for clear and interpretable results.

A standout aspect of this repository is real-time video processing. Using OpenCVâ€™s VideoCapture module, the application performs live inference on webcam feeds or video files with optimized frame-by-frame processing. Techniques like background subtraction, motion tracking, and frame skipping are included to maintain smooth and responsive performance, even on resource-constrained devices.

This repository serves as a practical toolkit for anyone interested in building and deploying computer vision applications. Whether you're prototyping object tracking systems, working on smart surveillance, or exploring visual AI for robotics, feel free to explore the codebase, test the examples, and adapt it to your own use case.
